# RandomChat

An application for messagging with other people, based on topic rooms. After users choose a room, the server will randomly match users in the same room.

Examples of topic rooms:
- *Games*
- *Movies*
- *Music*

and so on

In case there are no users in a room, the server stops the search after a default time of 60 seconds, but at any time users can stop the search for other users to start a chat.
